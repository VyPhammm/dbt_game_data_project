## Project Overview

The project leverages Apache Airflow for orchestration and DBT for seamless data transformation, efficiently ingesting data from multiple sources into Google Cloud Storage. The data is then organized into a **Data Lake** and **Data Warehouse** using Google BigQuery, ensuring optimized storage and high-performance querying.

### Features

- **Real-Time Data Syncing**: Supports synchronization with Firebase and Amazon S3 for up-to-date and consistent information.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Uses Apache Superset for monitoring and Slack for instant notifications on critical events.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provides insightful dashboards through Looker for data-driven decision-making.
